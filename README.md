This app allows the user to select one of 10 Chicago neighborhoods from a drop-down menu, and receive location and crime data about that neighborhood for the year 2018. Features include:

- An interactive Google-API generated map which zooms to the selected neighborhood and displays markers on the location of crimes of the single most frequently occurring crime type in that neighborhood, as well as locations of any homicides;
- A short data table summarizing crime statistics pulled from the Chicago Data Portal, noting the rates of the most prevalently-reported crime (generally theft), as well as violent crime (including homicide, robbery, battery, criminal sexual assault and other sex offenses) compared to the population of that neighborhood.

Future versions of this app will include:

- Images that relate more directly to each selected neighborhood;
- Data representation of all 77 Chicago neighborhoods;
- Comparison data for other aspects of neighborhood life, including food, transit, and parks.
